references:
- name: Meera R. (Engineering Manager, UPMC Enterprises)
  reference: Matt has a great positive attitude. He is extremely thorough with
    his work and delivers consistently on time. There has not been a single
    user story that he has taken on for a sprint, which he did not complete.
    In addition, once he completes his user stories, he looks for ways in
    which he can help his team meet its commitments. Matt's code reviews go
    above and beyond expectations since he takes the time to call out issues
    in the code and also provide information on what is the right approach and
    the justification for doing so. He has stepped up and helped with multiple
    dev-ops related initiatives on the team, while also balancing it with the
    feature development. Matt is an asset to his team and to UPMC Enterprises.
- name: Chris F. (Engineering Manager, Google)
  reference: Matt is a role model in many areas. He is a solid software
  engineer with exceptional technical abilities and he regularly hits his
  delivery dates with a high degree of quality. Matt tackled an obscure
  technology to address many quality issues with a fielded product. Matt dove
  into the technology, learned it, understood it and delivered. He has stood
  out on the team as a leader. People look up to him to perform code reviews
  and help with difficult problems.
